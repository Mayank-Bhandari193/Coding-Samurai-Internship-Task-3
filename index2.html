          <h2>The Benefits of Parallax Scrolling Like most web design techniques, parallax scrolling also has its unique set of benefits that have made it so popular. If you’re debating whether parallax website design is for you, these benefits might convince you to join the trend. Enhanced Storytelling Perhaps, parallax website design is best known for its ability to boost storytelling. It can help weave a story around a simple website structure. Parallax scrolling gives the perfect opportunity to add layers, details, and richness to a web design, compelling its message. These websites provide the visitor with a smooth browsing journey that’s exciting and effortless to follow along. All thats left is to scroll, scroll, scroll. More Microinteractions The allure of parallax scrolling lies in enabling simple, subtle micro-interactions between the website and the visitor that are typically absent on static websites. Such interactions can be a change of color when a user lands on a certain section, a cursor that transforms when hovered over text, etc.</h2>
